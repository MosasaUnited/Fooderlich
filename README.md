# fooderlich

As you know, everything in Flutter is a widget. But how do you know which widget to
use when? In this chapter, you’ll explore three categories of basic widgets, which you
can use for:
• Structure and navigation
• Displaying information
• Positioning widgets
By the end of this chapter, you’ll use those different types of widgets to build the
foundation of an app called Fooderlich, a social recipe app. You’ll build out the app’s
structure and learn how to create three different recipe cards: the main recipe card,
an author card and an explore card.
