# fooderlich

As you know, everything in Flutter is a widget. But how do you know which widget to
use when? In this chapter, you’ll explore three categories of basic widgets, which you
can use for:
• Structure and navigation
• Displaying information
• Positioning widgets
By the end of this chapter, you’ll use those different types of widgets to build the
foundation of an app called Fooderlich, a social recipe app. You’ll build out the app’s
structure and learn how to create three different recipe cards: the main recipe card,
an author card and an explore card.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Finishing Project

You did it! You’ve finished this chapter. Along the way, you’ve applied three different
categories of widgets. You learned how to use structural widgets to organize different
screens, and you created three custom recipe cards and applied different widget
layouts to each of them.
Well done!
Key points
• Three main categories of widgets are: structure and navigation; displaying
information; and, positioning widgets.
• There are two main visual design systems available in Flutter, Material and
Cupertino. They help you build apps that look native on Android and iOS,
respectively.
• Using the Material theme, you can build quite varied user interface elements to
give your app a custom look and feel.
• It’s generally a good idea to establish a common theme object for your app, giving
you a single source of truth for your app’s style.
• The Scaffold widget implements all your basic visual layout structure needs.
• The Container widget can be used to group other widgets together.
• The Stack widget layers child widgets on top of each other.
